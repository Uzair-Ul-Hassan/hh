            MEP services are essential to the design and operation of all types
            of buildings, from residential to commercial to industrial. MEP
            engineers design and implement the systems that provide heating,
            ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, lighting, power, and fire
            protection. Comfort and safety: MEP systems play a vital role in
            providing a comfortable and safe environment for building occupants.
            For example, HVAC systems regulate indoor temperature and humidity,
            while fire protection systems help to prevent and extinguish fires.
            Efficiency and sustainability: MEP systems can help to improve the
            energy efficiency and sustainability of buildings. For example,
            variable speed drives can be used to reduce the energy consumption
            of HVAC systems, while solar panels can be used to generate
            electricity on-site. Compliance: MEP systems must comply with a
            variety of codes and regulations. MEP engineers ensure that the
            systems they design meet all applicable requirements
