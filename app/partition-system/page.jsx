            We may configure the door to suit unique dimensions, color&apos;s
            and accessories such as door automatics, glass openings, adaptation
            for access control systems, etc. Hospital doors are expected to have
            smooth surfaces. Dirt-collecting joints and valves make routine
            cleaning difficult. There is a major chance that the door may be
            struck by hospital beds or other. Therefore, doors and frames must
            be constructed to withstand daily effects. Materials used in the
            door must be able to tolerate washing with different forms of
            chemicals without causing damage. A sophisticated range of automatic
            doors and barrier systems for the healthcare sector has been
            established with a keen desire to encourage and enable greater
            environmental control, allowing for an easy, touch-free and hygienic
            operation.
